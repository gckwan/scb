# scb (生词本) 

scb is a simple vocab-learning game written in React Native + Flow.

It's still a work-in-progress – code needs cleaning :) – but possible extensions could include:
- Sound effects when guessing words
- Background music
- Variable game length depending on the number of words in each category.
- Storing top scores and completion status for categories
- Authentication and persisting scores to server or native storage
- More content!
